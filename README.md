# Growth,Stability, and Decline: Rethinking Office Hubs and Post-Pandemic America

## Overview
Savills provided a dataset covering all known commercial lease transactions (2018–2024) across key U.S. markets. The pandemic disrupted this sector significantly. Our goal is to uncover spatial and temporal leasing patterns across submarkets to support strategic office placement for clients in Tech, Finance, Legal, and beyond.

## Methodology
- Filtered and segmented lease data into pre-/post-pandemic periods.
- Engineered submarket-level metrics (total SF, new/expansion SF, lease count, market share).
- Created submarket profiles (e.g., "Suburban-ClassO") as cost proxies.
- Classified submarkets using defined hotspot types (e.g., Growth Hub, Emerging Opportunity).
- Assigned weighted scores and normalized them to highlight relative market strength.

## Tools
- **Python**: pandas, numpy (data processing)
- **JavaScript**: D3.js, fullPage.js, Leaflet
- **HTML/CSS**: Bootstrap 5, custom animations(CSS)

## Output
An interactive data story visualized as a full-page website with:
- Hotspot map
- Ranked bar and pie charts
- Leasing trend timelines
- Client-facing recommendations
